# Create a single Pod of image httpd:2.4.41-alpine in Namespace default. 
# The Pod should be named pod1 and the container should be named pod1-container.
# Your manager would like to run a command manually on occasion to output the status of 
# that exact Pod. Please write a command that does this into /opt/course/2/pod1-status-command.sh. 
# The command should use kubectl.
